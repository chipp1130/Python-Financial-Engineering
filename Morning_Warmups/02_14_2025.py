# Custom Probability Distribution Sampler:
# Write a function that allows the user to define a custom discrete probability
# and then randomly sample from it according to the defined probabilities:

#   1. Ask the user to input possible outcomes (e.g, "Win", "Lose", "Draw")
#   2. Ask the user to input corresponding probabilities (must sum to 1.0).
#   3Ô∏è. Validate inputs (ensure probabilities sum to 1.0, handle invalid input).
#   4. Allow the user to sample from this distribution a specified number of times.
#   5. Return a dictionary showing the frequency of each outcome.
